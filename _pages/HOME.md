excerpt: 'The goal of **CSB (PI: Hong Li)**  is to understand cancer biology by computational approaches and high-throughput experiments. CSB focuses on mining and integration of omics data to identify biomarkers and key molecular events related to cancer evolution and treatment, and then construct prediction models for patient stratification. Currently, we are interested in developing new algorithms through artificial intelligence techniques to analyze single-cell and spatial omics data and apply them to understand progression from precancerous stages to cancer.'
