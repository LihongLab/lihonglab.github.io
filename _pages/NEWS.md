<small>A research team led by Prof. Hong Li from Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health (SINH) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, publicated a new research paper on _npj Precision Oncology_. </small>
<small>The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a crucial role in orchestrating tumor cell behavior and cancer progression. Recent advances in spatial profiling technologies have uncovered novel spatial signatures, including univariate distribution patterns, bivariate spatial relationships, and higher-order structures. These signatures have the potential to revolutionize tumor mechanism and treatment. This review summarize the current state of spatial signature research, highlighting computational methods to uncover spatially relevant biological significance. We discuss the impact of these advances on fundamental cancer biology and translational research, address current challenges and future research directions.</small>
<small>Si-yu Jing serve as the first authors, while Hong Li, both from the Cancer Systems Biology group at the Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health (SINH), CAS, serves as the corresponding author. This work was supported by the funding from National Natural Science Foundation of China, Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai and CAS Youth Innovation Promotion Association. </small>

<small>A research team led by Prof. Hong Li from Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health (SINH) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, developed and released a new toolkit named “SOAPy” for analyzing spatial omics data. </small>
<small>Spatial organization and microenvironment are important for understanding the tissues in normal and disease states. Spatial omics especially spatial transcriptomes have become popular in recent years, but extracting useful information from these complex spatial data is still challenging. Previous algorithms were often designed for one specific task, so a toolkit for the integrative analysis of microenvironmental spatial organization is in an urgent need.</small>
<small>Prof Li’s group developed a Python package named “SOAPy”. It provides methods for spatial domain identification, spatial expression tendency, spatiotemporal expression pattern, cellular co-localization, multi-cellular niches, and cell–cell communication. SOAPy can be applied to various spatial omics technologies and multiple areas in physiological and pathological contexts, such as tumor biology and development biology. </small>
<small>In summary, this study presents a valuable tool for spatial omics analysis, facilitating the dissection of microenvironment architecture and deepening biological insights.</small>

## November
* Cancer Systems Biology group contributes a research paper entitled ["A disentangled generative model for improved drug response prediction in patients via sample synthesis"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpha.2024.101128) in _Journal of Pharmaceutical Analysis_.

<small>Personalized drug response prediction from molecular data is an important challenge in precision medicine for treating cancer. Computational methods have been widely explored and have become increasingly accurate in recent years. However, the clinical application of prediction methods is still in its infancy due to large discrepancies between preclinial models and patients. We present a novel disentangled synthesis transfer network (DiSyn) for drug response prediction specifically designed for transfer learning from preclinical models to clinical patients. DiSyn uses a domain separation network to disentangle drug response-related features, employs data synthesis technology to increase the sample size and iteratively trains for better feature disentanglement. DiSyn is pretrained on large-scale unlabeled cancer samples and validated by three datasets, TCGA, I-SPY2 and NIBR PDXE, achieving competitive accuracy with the state-of-the-art methods on cancer patients and mice. Furthermore, the application of DiSyn to thousands of breast cancer patients show the heterogeneity in drug responses and demonstrate its potential value in biomarker discovery and drug combination prediction.</small>

<small>Accurate and robust estimation of the synergistic drug combination is important for medicine precision. Although some computational methods have been developed, some predictions are still unreliable especially for the cross-dataset predictions, due to the complex mechanism of drug combinations and heterogeneity of cancer samples. We have proposed JointSyn that utilizes dual-view jointly learning to predict sample-specific effects of drug combination from drug and cell features. JointSyn outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in predictive accuracy and robustness across various benchmarks. Each view of JointSyn captures drug synergy-related characteristics and make complementary contributes to the final pre-diction of drug combination. Moreover, JointSyn with fine-tuning improves its generalization ability to predict a novel drug combination or cancer sample using a small number of experimental measure-ments. We also used JointSyn to generate an estimated atlas of drug synergy for pan-cancer and explored the differential pattern among cancers. These results demonstrate the potential of JointSyn to predict drug synergy, supporting the development of personalized combinatorial therapies.</small>

* Cancer Systems Biology group contributes a research paper entitled ["Spatial multiomics reveals a subpopulation of fibroblasts associated with cancer stemness in human hepatocellular carcinoma"](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13073-024-01367-8) in _Genome Medicine_.

<small>Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the prominent cell type in the tumor microenvironment (TME), and CAF subsets have been identified in various tumors. However, how CAFs spatially coordinate other cell populations within the liver TME to promote cancer progression remain unclear. In the study,  researchers combined multi-region proteomics (6 patients, 24 samples), 10X Genomics Visium spatial transcriptomics (11 patients, 25 samples) and multiplexed imaging (92 patients, 264 samples) technologies to decipher the expression heterogeneity, functional diversity, spatial distribution, colocalization and interaction of fibroblasts. The newly identified CAF subpopulation was validated by cells isolated from 5 liver cancer patients and in vitro functional assays. The study identified a liver CAF subpopulation, marked by the expression of COL1A2, COL4A1, COL4A2, CTGF and FSTL1 and named F5-CAF. F5-CAF preferentially located within and around tumor nests and colocalizes with cancer cells with higher stemness in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Multiplexed staining of 92 patients and the bulk transcriptome of 371 patients demonstrated that the abundance of F5-CAFs in HCC was associated with a worse prognosis. Further in vitro experiments showed that F5-CAFs isolated from liver cancer patients can promote the proliferation and stemness of HCC cells.</small>

* Cancer Systems Biology group contributes a research paper entitled ["Applying machine learning for multi-individual Raman spectroscopic data to identify different stages of proliferating human hepatocytes"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2024.109500) in _iScience_.

<small>Cell therapy using proliferating human hepatocytes (ProliHHs) is an effective treatment approach for advanced liver diseases. However, rapid and accurate identification of high-quality ProliHHs from different donors is challenging due to individual heterogeneity. Here, we developed a machine learning framework to integrate single-cell Raman spectroscopy from multiple donors and identify different stages of ProliHHs. A repository of more than 14,000 Raman spectra, consisting of primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) and different passages of ProliHHs from six donors, was generated. Using a sliding window algorithm, potential biomarkers distinguishing the different cell stages were identified through differential analysis. Leveraging machine learning models, accurate classification of cell stages was achieved in both within-donor and cross-donor prediction tasks. Furthermore, the study assessed the relationship between donor and cell numbers and its impact on prediction accuracy, facilitating improved quality control design. A similar workflow can also be extended to encompass other cell types.</small>

<small>Recently, our lab contributes a review article entitled “Single-cell and spatially resolved transcriptomics for liver biology”. We introduced the basic knowledge about single-cell and spatially resolved techniques and the state-of-art computational tools used for data processing. Four common scenes were summarized when applying these techniques in the study of liver biology: (a) constructing the liver single-cell atlas; (b) the deduction of cellular transitions; (c) the characterization of tissue microenvironments; (d) the identification of potential therapy targets (Fig. 1). The four scenarios were seen in the settings of liver homeostasis, embryonic liver development, liver regeneration, non-alcoholic liver disease (NAFLD) and liver cancer. In each topic, we presented the cutting-edge progresses uncovered by single-cell and/or spatial techniques, such as the single-cell atlas of the liver under both diseased and homeostatic conditions (Fig. 2a), transcriptomic zonal patterns of hepatic cells (Fig. 2b), developmental trajectory of embryonic liver (Fig. 3), cell identity conversion of parenchymal cells upon injury, NAFLD-associated cell subtypes (Fig. 4), and cancer-associated cell populations within tumor microenvironments (Fig. 5). We highlighted the computational strategies that help achieve these accomplishments; and discussed the outstanding questions remaining elusive. Lastly, we pointed out the challenges when applying these technologies to the liver biology, and for each of which, we proposed possible solutions.</small>

<small>Stem cell-independent reprogramming of differentiated cells has recently been identified as an important paradigm for repairing injured tissues. Following periportal injury, mature hepatocytes re-activate reprogramming/progenitor-related genes (RRGs) and dedifferentiate into liver progenitor-like cells (LPLCs) in both mice and humans, which contribute remarkably to regeneration. However, it remains unknown which and how external factors trigger hepatocyte reprogramming. Here, by employing single-cell transcriptional profiling we reconstructed the cellular trajectory of LPLC formation and deciphered the key pathways underlying cellular state transition during the process (Figure 1). We found that immune related pathways were highly correlated with LPLC formation. By utilizing lineage-specific deletion tools, we uncovered that periportal-specific LPLC formation was initiated by regionally activated Kupffer cells but not peripheral monocyte-derived macrophages (Figure 2). Unexpectedly, using in vivo screening, the proinflammatory factor IL-6 was identified as the niche signal repurposed for RRG induction via STAT3 activation, which drove RRG expression through binding to their pre-accessible enhancers. Notably, RRGs were activated through injury-specific rather than liver embryogenesis-related enhancers. Collectively, these findings depict an injury-specific niche signal and the inflammation-mediated transcription in driving the conversion of hepatocytes into a progenitor phenotype (Figure 2).

  <small>Drug sensitivity prediction is an important and challenging problem in both bioinformatics and translational medicine. Various categories of methods have been developed and compared. However, previous benchmark studies have rarely discussed the predictive ability of preclinical models on clinical patients, and not comprehensively covered the paradigms of deep learning methods.
  To provide a more rigorous assessment, the performance of six representative deep learning methods for drug response prediction in multiple application scenarios was benchmarked, including the overall prediction accuracyusing nine evaluation metrics, predictability of each drug, potential associated factors and transferability to clinical cohorts. Most methods show promising prediction within cell line datasets (Figure 1). TGSA, with its lower time cost and better performance, is recommended. The performance metrics decrease when applying models trained on cell lines to patients (Figure 2), due to the differences between cell lines and patients, the lack of drug sensitivity related features and the reduction of statistical power due to small sample sizes. However, clinical response on some drugs can still be distinguished using CRDNN and TGSA models. These assessments provide a guidance for researchers to choose appropriate methods, as well as insights into future directions for the development of more effective methods in clinical scenarios.
