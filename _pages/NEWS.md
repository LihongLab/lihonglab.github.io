## December

* Congrats to professor Li for being awarded for "2022 Excellent Member Award, Youth Innovation Promotion Association, Chinese Academy of Sciences" !

* Cancer Systems Biology group contributes a benchmarking paper entitled [“A systematic assessment of deep learning methods for drug response prediction: from in vitro to clinical applications”](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/09dBX0DAGto6RA0waZH4fw) in _Briefings in Bioinformatics_.

  <small>Drug sensitivity prediction is an important and challenging problem in both bioinformatics and translational medicine. Various categories of methods have been developed and compared. However, previous benchmark studies have rarely discussed the predictive ability of preclinical models on clinical patients, and not comprehensively covered the paradigms of deep learning methods.
  To provide a more rigorous assessment, the performance of six representative deep learning methods for drug response prediction in multiple application scenarios was benchmarked, including the overall prediction accuracyusing nine evaluation metrics, predictability of each drug, potential associated factors and transferability to clinical cohorts. Most methods show promising prediction within cell line datasets (Figure 1). TGSA, with its lower time cost and better performance, is recommended. The performance metrics decrease when applying models trained on cell lines to patients (Figure 2), due to the differences between cell lines and patients, the lack of drug sensitivity related features and the reduction of statistical power due to small sample sizes. However, clinical response on some drugs can still be distinguished using CRDNN and TGSA models. These assessments provide a guidance for researchers to choose appropriate methods, as well as insights into future directions for the development of more effective methods in clinical scenarios.
  Bihan Shen and Fangyoumin Feng serve as co-first authors. Professor Hong Li serves as the corresponding author. Kunshi Li and Ping Lin also contributed to this work. We thank Bio-Med Big Data Center at Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, Xin Li (Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, CAS) and Wenju Cai (Guizhou science data center Gui’an Supercomputing Center) for providing computational resource and discussions. This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China, Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai, National Key R&D Program of China, CAS Youth Innovation Promotion Association and the development fund for Shanghai talents.</small>
