<small>Recently, our lab contributes a review article entitled “Single-cell and spatially resolved transcriptomics for liver biology”. We introduced the basic knowledge about single-cell and spatially resolved techniques and the state-of-art computational tools used for data processing. Four common scenes were summarized when applying these techniques in the study of liver biology: (a) constructing the liver single-cell atlas; (b) the deduction of cellular transitions; (c) the characterization of tissue microenvironments; (d) the identification of potential therapy targets (Fig. 1). The four scenarios were seen in the settings of liver homeostasis, embryonic liver development, liver regeneration, non-alcoholic liver disease (NAFLD) and liver cancer. In each topic, we presented the cutting-edge progresses uncovered by single-cell and/or spatial techniques, such as the single-cell atlas of the liver under both diseased and homeostatic conditions (Fig. 2a), transcriptomic zonal patterns of hepatic cells (Fig. 2b), developmental trajectory of embryonic liver (Fig. 3), cell identity conversion of parenchymal cells upon injury, NAFLD-associated cell subtypes (Fig. 4), and cancer-associated cell populations within tumor microenvironments (Fig. 5). We highlighted the computational strategies that help achieve these accomplishments; and discussed the outstanding questions remaining elusive. Lastly, we pointed out the challenges when applying these technologies to the liver biology, and for each of which, we proposed possible solutions.</small>

* Cancer Systems Biology group contributes a research paper entitled ["Kupffer cell-derived IL-6 is repurposed for hepatocyte dedifferentiation via activating progenitor genes from injury-specific enhancers"](https://www.cell.com/cell-stem-cell/fulltext/S1934-5909(23)00009-7) in _Cell Stem Cell_.

<small>Stem cell-independent reprogramming of differentiated cells has recently been identified as an important paradigm for repairing injured tissues. Following periportal injury, mature hepatocytes re-activate reprogramming/progenitor-related genes (RRGs) and dedifferentiate into liver progenitor-like cells (LPLCs) in both mice and humans, which contribute remarkably to regeneration. However, it remains unknown which and how external factors trigger hepatocyte reprogramming. Here, by employing single-cell transcriptional profiling we reconstructed the cellular trajectory of LPLC formation and deciphered the key pathways underlying cellular state transition during the process (Figure 1). We found that immune related pathways were highly correlated with LPLC formation. By utilizing lineage-specific deletion tools, we uncovered that periportal-specific LPLC formation was initiated by regionally activated Kupffer cells but not peripheral monocyte-derived macrophages (Figure 2). Unexpectedly, using in vivo screening, the proinflammatory factor IL-6 was identified as the niche signal repurposed for RRG induction via STAT3 activation, which drove RRG expression through binding to their pre-accessible enhancers. Notably, RRGs were activated through injury-specific rather than liver embryogenesis-related enhancers. Collectively, these findings depict an injury-specific niche signal and the inflammation-mediated transcription in driving the conversion of hepatocytes into a progenitor phenotype (Figure 2).

  <small>Drug sensitivity prediction is an important and challenging problem in both bioinformatics and translational medicine. Various categories of methods have been developed and compared. However, previous benchmark studies have rarely discussed the predictive ability of preclinical models on clinical patients, and not comprehensively covered the paradigms of deep learning methods.
  To provide a more rigorous assessment, the performance of six representative deep learning methods for drug response prediction in multiple application scenarios was benchmarked, including the overall prediction accuracyusing nine evaluation metrics, predictability of each drug, potential associated factors and transferability to clinical cohorts. Most methods show promising prediction within cell line datasets (Figure 1). TGSA, with its lower time cost and better performance, is recommended. The performance metrics decrease when applying models trained on cell lines to patients (Figure 2), due to the differences between cell lines and patients, the lack of drug sensitivity related features and the reduction of statistical power due to small sample sizes. However, clinical response on some drugs can still be distinguished using CRDNN and TGSA models. These assessments provide a guidance for researchers to choose appropriate methods, as well as insights into future directions for the development of more effective methods in clinical scenarios.
